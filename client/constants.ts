export const NEW_TAROT_CARD_MEANINGS_STANDARD: Record<string, string> = {
  "The Fool":
    "A soul at the threshold, foot lifted, eyes bright — The Fool embodies pure potential, the spark before wisdom. It's the invitation to begin, unburdened, trusting the unknown. \n\n At the center of this card floats a whimsical jester’s cap — split between crimson red and ivory white. One side dances with black stars, bold and impulsive. The other glimmers with gentle moons, dreamy and intuitive. This duality speaks of your own internal tug-of-war between impulsive courage and quiet wonder. The Fool is not foolish, my dear — it is the sacred beginner, the cosmic spark before the journey even knows its path. \n\n Surrounding the hat is the cycle of the moon, each phase glowing in a celestial circle. This is no accident. The Fool walks forward not with certainty, but with trust in cycles. In your life now, something is beginning — whether you’ve leapt already or are hesitating at the edge. These moon phases whisper: “There is time. You are allowed to change, to grow, to stumble, and to bloom again.” \n\n Notice how the cap hovers — weightless, free, unanchored. You are being invited to unburden. That heavy past you carry? Let it fall behind you like an old coat. You are not meant to know the whole journey. You are meant only to trust the step ahead. \n\n A bold new chapter is calling — trust it. Let your curiosity be your compass, not fear. Align with the rhythm of the moon and take the leap, even if you don’t see the ground below. The universe has already woven the net to catch you.",
  "The Magician":
    "Veiled and serene, The High Priestess holds the mysteries of the unconscious. She is intuition incarnate—whispering that the unseen realms are just as real as the visible. \n\n Hands poised between earth and sky, The Magician channels will into reality. He is the master of manifestation, showing that intention and skill can transform dreams into deeds. \n\n At the center of this vivid golden card, a single hand emerges — steady, deliberate, masterful. It wields a wand tipped with a shining white star, sparking with radiant intention. This is the hand of the manifestor. Of one who doesn’t just wish, but acts. The background hums with cosmic power, and yet, it is you who channels it. \n\n Surrounding the card, four sacred symbols reside in each corner: the pentacle, the cup, the sword, and the wand. Earth. Water. Air. Fire. You hold access to them all — a rare balance. These aren’t just tools — they are your tools. And the infinity symbol below them? It whispers of limitless potential — as long as you stay attuned to your purpose. \n\n The red cuff on the wrist is no accident. It’s bold, passionate, primal. You’ve passed through The Fool’s dreamworld — now you awaken to the fire in your blood, the magic in your fingertips. This is the card of conscious creation. No more drifting. Now is the time to shape. \n\n You have everything you need. The question is no longer if, but how you will wield your power. You are the magician now — able to conjure reality from vision. Just be sure your heart is aligned with your will, or the spell will scatter.",
  "The High Priestess":
    "Two trees rise like twin pillars: one black, marked with a B; one white, marked with a J. Boaz and Jachin — the ancient sentinels of mystery and duality. You stand at their threshold now, invited not to act, but to receive. This card says: the answers are already within you… if only you’ll listen. \n\n In the center, sacred symbols hover with intention: The silver orb cradled in a crescent — the moon at rest, holding secrets not yet spoken. The pomegranate, ripe and red, speaks of hidden knowledge, of Persephone’s descent and the sacred contract of transformation. What are you keeping buried deep, and what might bloom if revealed? And below it all, the crescent moon, glowing like a cradle of divine intuition. \n\n All around, tiny moons drift across a turquoise sky like dream fragments — intuition flowing beneath consciousness. The High Priestess is not of logic or light, but of feeling, symbol, and silence. \n\n This is not a time for external validation or outward declarations. This is a sacred pause. Something beneath the surface is stirring — a truth, a desire, a memory. You are being asked to honor the unknown. To retreat. To protect what is still gestating. \n\n Be still now. What you seek is not out there — it’s in the hush between thoughts, in the night of your soul. Trust your dreams, your gut, your sacred knowing. There is power in not-knowing. Let mystery work its quiet magic on you.",
  "The Empress":
    "Seated on her throne of abundance, The Empress is fertility, nurturance, and creativity at its most compassionate. She invites growth, comfort, and the beauty of sensory life. \n\n A rich red heart floats at the card’s center, pulsing with divine femininity — adorned with the Venus symbol, radiant in pearled shimmer. This is the heart of creation, of sensuality, of love made manifest in form. Above it, a grand crown gleams with twelve golden stars — a celestial diadem echoing the zodiac, the rhythms of nature, and the eternal cycle of growth. \n\n  Below, tulips bloom in tender reds, standing tall and lush. These are not idle flowers. They are emblems of fertility, pleasure, and beauty — the lush, physical rewards of connection to the Earth and self. \n\n Where the High Priestess was the gatekeeper of secrets, The Empress is the living embodiment of their fruits. She is the mother, the lover, the muse, and the healer. Her power is not in what she withholds, but in what she nurtures. This card asks: What are you ready to give love to? What do you long to grow? \n\n The sunrays at the top arch overhead like divine blessings. This is a fertile time, whether you are creating a home, a relationship, a body of work — or even a new version of yourself. \n\n Nurture what matters. Let pleasure be your compass. The divine feminine is calling you to soften, to root, and to trust the process of becoming. You are ready to birth something real — something beautiful. Let it begin in love.",
  "The Emperor":
    "A pillar of authority, The Emperor stands for structure, power, and disciplined leadership. He is the lawmaker who channels strength into order, forging stability from vision. \n\n At the center of this card rests a crown — bold, red, and structured. No longer floating amid flowers or stars, this crown is framed in an oval mirror, reflecting back the power of identity and the force of form. This is not just about rule — it is about reflection, about ownership of one’s throne. \n\n The crown itself is structured and symmetrical — topped with golden arches, stars of authority, and a central crescent motif — a callback to divine right, but also a reminder that power must balance clarity with intuition. Around it, a rich red-orange background burns like the embers of a hearth or the banners of war. It demands action, decisiveness, order. \n\n The scrollwork in the corners — marked subtly with pentacles — reinforces this: manifestation requires form. While The Empress grows the garden, The Emperor builds the walls to protect it. He is the guardian of law, tradition, and structure — not to restrict, but to stabilize. \n\n This card asks: where in your life do you need to take command? Where must boundaries be drawn, schedules honored, or leadership embraced? This is a time for foundations. For stepping into the role of protector, planner, and sovereign. \n\n You are being asked to step into your power — not with brute force, but with authority rooted in wisdom. Set your boundaries. Build what is lasting. Do not fear responsibility; it is your mantle now. Wear the crown, but never forget to look in the mirror and ask: What kind of ruler am I becoming?",
  "The Hierophant":
    "Keeper of tradition and sacred wisdom, The Hierophant bridges heaven and community. He teaches that ritual and shared values can offer guidance and collective identity. \n\n Two ornate keys — one gold, one iron — cross like a seal at the heart of this card. They are not just tools; they are invitations. One unlocks the world of matter, the other the realm of spirit. Together, they represent the union of the seen and unseen — and the importance of guidance in bridging them. \n\n Above, a golden crescent moon hangs delicately, crowned by a shining star. This celestial symbol suggests that true enlightenment is both received and revealed. Like the star tethered beneath the arc of the crescent, wisdom must be suspended in humility — not grasped, but honored. \n\n Flanking the moon, red laurel fronds curl toward the heavens, evoking sacred ceremony, ancient rites, and the fire of devotion. Below, leafy greens rise — growth rooted in tradition, the natural wisdom of things that endure. \n\n This card speaks of spiritual inheritance, of learning through trusted systems — whether religious, philosophical, or familial. It may signal a mentor, a teacher, or the call to become one. It urges you to ask: What are you devoted to? Who do you trust to guide your steps? \n\n You are being invited to remember — to reconnect with a source of wisdom greater than yourself. This is not a time to rebel, but to listen, to study, to commit. Let tradition nourish you like rain to roots. Ask the old questions. Honor the sacred. And carry what matters forward.",
  "The Lovers":
    "Under a radiant sky, The Lovers embody harmony, choice, and connection. They reflect the power of unity and the soul’s longing for meaningful bonds and authentic decisions. \n\n At the heart of this card — quite literally — is a red heart, glowing with warmth and intention. Within it, two hands clasp: one adorned with a frilled cuff, the other plain and strong. There is balance here — yin and yang, soft and solid, two forces in sacred agreement. Their hands form not just connection, but commitment. \n\n Above, green vines and white-and-gold daisies hang like a wedding garland, speaking of blessing, purity, and joy that blooms in shared light. Below, a branch stretches out, delicate yet gnarled — and from it hangs a single, tempting red apple. A symbol of knowledge, of desire, of Eden itself. \n\n This card is not naive. It knows that love always carries choice. The apple hangs heavy: Do you bite? Do you reach? With love comes truth — about yourself, about the other. And from truth, there is no turning away. \n\n In relationships, this card may herald a fated connection, a test of trust, or a moment of deeper intimacy. In life at large, it reflects the soul’s desire to align with what feels right, not just what looks good on paper. You must now ask: What do I truly want? And am I willing to be seen to receive it? \n\n Love — in all its forms — asks you to choose. Not from fear, or habit, but from your truth. There is no hiding here. If your heart knows the answer, follow it. If it does not, wait until it does. But do not look away from the question. You are ready.",
  "The Chariot":
    "Armor-clad confidence hurtles forward — The Chariot is victory through focus and willpower. It reminds us that triumph comes not just from strength, but from steering conflicting forces. \n\n At the center of this card stands a chariot, crowned in a rich red canopy like a royal tent — a sacred carriage cloaked in protection and purpose. The curtains part as if awaiting your presence. This is no ordinary vehicle. This is a vessel of victory, a throne on wheels, built for the warrior of spirit. \n\n Above, a crescent moon rests between two clouds, shining amid a star-strewn black sky. This is intuition as compass, lighting the way even when the road is shadowed. The shield at the front of the chariot, emblazoned again with the crescent, reminds us: to move forward in alignment, we must balance logic and instinct, ambition and stillness. \n\n Below the wheels, green laurel leaves rise — signs of growth, success, and earned triumph. This card does not promise an easy ride — but it does assure you that victory is possible if you stay in control. \n\n But notice — there are no animals drawing this chariot. It is propelled not by horses or beasts, but by your will alone. That is the secret of The Chariot: it moves because you decide to move it. If you feel stalled in life, this card whispers: the reins have always been in your hands. \n\n You are being called to step up. Now is the time to gather your focus, declare your direction, and move with boldness. There will be doubt. There may be delay. But if your will is strong and your heart aligned, the universe will part like a curtain before your stride. Drive forward — this moment is yours to claim.",
  Strength:
    "A serene figure calmly taming a beast — Strength reveals that power is gentleness, and courage is compassion. True mastery comes from the heart, not the fist. \n\n A golden-maned lion sits in still majesty, its eyes unwavering, its power felt more than shown. Its body is relaxed, yet the gaze is piercing — a force of quiet knowing. This is not the strength of muscle. This is the strength of spirit. \n\n The lion sits framed within a stone arch, suggesting initiation, a rite of passage that requires not force but presence. You’ve passed through trials — and now you’re being asked not to react, but to contain. Strength here is about resilience, patience, grace under pressure. \n\n Above, the planets and stars glimmer in a dark sky — Saturn, the teacher of time and discipline, floats beside a shooting star. These celestial signs remind you that strength must be sustained. This isn’t just a moment of courage — it’s the ongoing choice to stay centered in every moment. \n\n The lion’s mane — flowing like fire — also represents passion, instinct, and raw life-force. But it is calm. Contained. Harmonized. This card teaches you how to be with your power without needing to wield it outwardly. \n\n True strength is not domination. It is the ability to meet chaos with stillness. To greet the wild lion within you — your fears, your passions, your raw truths — and love it into peace. You are stronger than you know, and gentler than you’ve allowed. Let both be true.",
  "The Hermit":
    "Lit from within, The Hermit withdraws to seek inner truth. He guides us toward introspection and the quiet revelations that emerge when we make space for solitude. \n\n At the heart of this card glows a lantern, golden and warm, cupped in two hands as if it were something fragile and sacred. It is not a blazing torch — it is a gentle guide, meant to illuminate only the next step. Within this lantern, stars swirl like secrets — a galaxy contained in the flame of awareness. \n\n The background is filled with constellations and a deep teal sky — evoking both vastness and order. This is a card of personal truth in the cosmic context. You are being asked to pull back from the noise, to stop reaching outward for meaning, and to find it within your own sky. \n\n Note the hands: soft, human, humble. There is no throne here, no crowd. Just the journeyer and the light. This is the path of the seeker, the sage, the one who knows that answers born of silence are the ones that last. \n\n The four golden stars around the lantern are more than decoration — they represent the guiding truths that always return when you listen long enough: simplicity, stillness, authenticity, and inner wisdom. \n\n Now is a time for retreat. Not to escape, but to realign. Turn off the outside voices. Hold your own lantern. Walk the path that only you can see. You are your own teacher now — and what you seek is already seeking you, in the quiet corners of your own soul.",
  "Wheel of Fortune":
    "Turning silently on mysterious hubs, this wheel is fate, cycles, and the dance between fortune and challenge. It tells us that change is the only constant in life’s grand design. \n\n At the center spins the orange wheel, etched with letters spelling out T-A-R-O — a nod to tarot, rota (Latin for “wheel”), and the endless cycle that connects beginnings and endings as one. Symbols align around its core like celestial gears, each representing the fixed energies of the zodiac — the cosmic blueprint of your unfolding life. \n\n Yet atop this great turning sits a surprise: a gray cat, curled peacefully in slumber. Here is the hidden message — acceptance. The cat sleeps not because it controls the wheel, but because it trusts it. This card teaches: peace is not found in control, but in surrender to timing. \n\n The background is bright and sky-blue, filled with scattered golden stars and enclosed by billowing clouds — suggesting divine presence, unseen forces at work, and a cosmic hand spinning the wheel just out of sight. This is luck, synchronicity, karma — call it what you will. You are part of a greater pattern now. \n\n You may be on the upswing or the descent — but neither lasts. The wheel spins on. And your task? Stay centered as it does. \n\n Change is arriving — or already underway. You cannot stop the cycle, but you can choose how you ride it. Embrace the shift. Rest when you’re high, breathe when you’re low. All is movement. All is meaningful. And even what feels random is part of your divine pattern.",
  Justice:
    "Measured, precise, and impartial, Justice wields the scales and the sword. She reminds us that truth matters, that fairness must be upheld, and that every choice bears consequence. \n\n At the heart of the card, a tall golden scale stands centered — radiant, balanced, and still. On the left, the sun burns bright — truth, reason, illumination. On the right, the crescent moon and stars glow softly — intuition, feeling, shadow. Justice does not reject one for the other. She weighs both, and she weighs them fairly. \n\n This balance is no mere decoration — it is cosmic law. Whether karmic, moral, legal, or personal, Justice reminds you: every action shapes its own mirror. The scales are always measuring. Not to punish — but to reveal. \n\n The red curtains that flank the scene suggest a stage, a theater of life — but now the drama pauses. The spotlight is on what truly matters: honesty, integrity, self-accountability. What are you willing to see clearly, even if it challenges you? \n\n There is no sword in this depiction, no harshness — only illumination. This is not about judgment from others. It is about looking in the mirror and asking: Have I been true? If so, this is your moment of alignment. If not, it is your invitation to course-correct. \n\n The universe is not blind — it is just. You are being asked to see clearly now, and to act with full integrity. Don’t twist the truth. Don’t ignore what you already know. What you weigh now will echo into what you carry forward. Choose balance. Choose truth.",
  "The Hangedman":
    "Upside down but enlightened, The Hanged Man shows that pause, sacrifice, and changed perspective can yield profound clarity and spiritual rebirth. \n\n Tied gently against the great trunk of a tree, a single leg hangs downward, wrapped in crimson cloth — the color of sacrifice, passion, and grounded life-force. The other leg is hidden, bent behind the bark. This tree is more than wood — it is the world tree, the axis of transformation. What grows here is not seen, but deeply felt. \n\n Leaves drift softly down, echoing the season of letting go. The bindings around the tree are not tight, not cruel — they are a willing stillness. This card shows not a man in pain, but in suspension. In becoming. This is the sacred pause between breath and motion. \n\n Look closely: the figure is not struggling. The Hanged Man chooses this position to see the world from a new angle. To turn things upside down in order to finally understand. This card doesn’t demand action — it demands sacrifice of ego, of certainty, of the old way of seeing. \n\n This is the card of initiates. Of those who willingly step into liminal space in order to emerge transformed. \n\n Let go. Surrender the urge to fix, to push, to know. You are in sacred suspension. This moment is not a punishment — it is an invitation to see with new eyes. The insight you need cannot be taken — it must be received. Wait. Watch. Trust. The turning comes.",
  Death:
    "Not an ending of life, but of phase — Death clears the old to make room for the new. It is transformation incarnate, urging release and welcoming metamorphosis. \n\n A solitary crow, black as the void between stars, perches atop a crystal orb — a globe of mysteries, surrounded by golden stars and the image of Saturn, the lord of time and endings. The crow sees all, even the things we wish to ignore. It is not a harbinger of doom, but a guide between worlds. \n\n Around it, vivid red roses bloom — symbols of beauty, life, love, and rebirth. These are not funeral flowers; they are threshold offerings. Their presence tells you: something must end, but what comes next will carry the color of your own soul in bloom. \n\n The backdrop is black, yes — but not empty. Shooting stars and diamond-shaped lights rain gently around the scene, suggesting divine presence in the darkness. The death this card brings is not random. It is ripe. Earned. Necessary. \n\n This card asks: What have you outgrown? What are you afraid to release? Whether it is an identity, a relationship, a fear, a belief — you are being asked to surrender it fully, so that you may walk forward unburdened.",
  Temperance:
    "Water flows between cups under angelic wings — Temperance blends opposites with grace. It teaches balance, moderation, and the alchemical art of harmonizing within. \n\n Two golden cups stand in flowing water, each brimming with liquid life. A stream arcs from one vessel to the other — a perfect arc, suspended mid-motion. This is not a spill. This is ritual. The exchange between inner and outer, dark and light, action and rest. \n\n Behind them rises a soft blue river, winding between tall green reeds, symbols of adaptation and growth. These are not still waters — they move, yet remain calm. They teach that flow does not require chaos. The landscape is quiet. Purposeful. Sacred. \n\n Above, the golden sun radiates, high and strong — not scorching, but illuminating. It blesses the exchange below, reminding us that healing takes place not in extremes, but in harmony. \n\n Temperance is the integration of transformation. You’ve shed what was. Now you must blend what remains. You are not being asked to rush, to perfect, or to fix. You are being asked to balance, to temper, to tend to your inner chemistry with gentleness and care. \n\n This card whispers of recovery. Of making peace with paradox. Of re-learning your rhythm after everything changed. \n\n Be patient. Something sacred is blending within you — don’t rush the process. Pour from one part of yourself into another until equilibrium is restored. This is holy work. You are not broken — you are being balanced.",
  "The Devil":
    "Chains clattering in the night, The Devil reminds us of our shadows — attachment, temptation, and unhealthy patterns. Recognizing the trap is the first step to liberation. \n\n At the heart of the card is a white ram skull, crowned with tall, coiling horns — ancient, primal, and immovable. This is power without tenderness, survival without compassion. Yet it is surrounded by beauty: orange roses, vivid and blooming, as if temptation itself were dressed in flowers. These are your distractions — beautiful, but possibly binding. \n\n To the left, a flickering red flame curls upward — the fire of impulse, of passion untamed. To the right, a sprig of red berries hangs temptingly, echoing the myth of Persephone — sweet, seductive, irreversible. You have tasted something. The question is: Did it nourish, or did it claim you? \n\n Above the skull floats a golden star, still shining. A reminder that even in darkness, light persists. You are never beyond redemption — only beyond denial. The Devil’s grip is voluntary, whether we admit it or not. \n\n The black background hums with subtle white stars, almost lost behind the intensity of the card’s symbols. They are always there — your higher self, your truth — but when you are trapped in obsession, fear, or addiction, they are harder to see. \n\n What chains do you pretend are jewelry? What stories keep you small because they are comfortable? You are being called to face the truth of what holds you — and realize: the door has never been locked. Walk away. Or stay consciously. But stop pretending you are powerless.",
  "The Tower":
    "Lightning strikes the stronghold — The Tower brings sudden upheaval. It is the collapse of illusions, clearing the ground for truth and real foundations. \n\n A tall gray tower, stoic and proud, rises alone from jagged ochre cliffs. Flames roar from its windows and blaze from its crown — a clear sign that what once stood as strength has now become a prison. Lightning strikes from all sides, not in malice, but in cosmic precision. The false must fall. \n\n Above, clouds billow in a turbulent sky. Bright, jagged bolts of lightning — the raw, divine will of sudden realization — pierce the dark like truth cutting through illusion. You cannot stay where you are. Something is crumbling for a reason. \n\n The tower was built high to avoid vulnerability — to stand above. But isolation is no longer safety. The fire consumes not out of cruelty, but necessity. And still, there are no figures falling — not yet. You are being given a moment to leap willingly. \n\n This card doesn’t predict doom — it illuminates what is unstable. It reveals what must be released: false foundations, egoic illusions, outdated structures. It hurts. But it frees. \n\n Let it burn. Let it fall. Stop trying to save what was never meant to last. This is divine intervention — not to destroy you, but to destroy what stands between you and truth. The collapse is sacred. Stand in the ashes. Build again — this time, honestly.",
  "The Star":
    "A figure under a cosmic sky — The Star bestows hope, inspiration, and serene insight. It is the soul’s promise: replenish, believe, dream, and let your inner light guide the way. \n\n A radiant golden star shines at the center, surrounded by seven white stars — a constellation of clarity, guidance, and grace. These are not random sparks in the dark. They are reminders: you are never lost, only realigning with your celestial path. \n\n Behind them, a deep teal sky hums with constellations — traced in pale, geometric lines — as if the entire cosmos is sketching out your next chapter. Below, golden hills rise and fall gently, evoking sacred ground, the slow return of life beneath your feet. \n\n There is no urgency here. No judgment. Only light. Only truth. The Star appears when the worst has passed — and though the ruins may still smolder, something beautiful now rises in your chest. Faith. Vulnerability. Peace. \n\n This card asks you to trust again. Not blindly, but soulfully. Trust that you are guided. That healing is happening. That what is meant for you is now being drawn closer, like a tide returning to shore. \n\n Let your heart open again. Let yourself believe that beauty is possible — even here. Especially here. You are still held by the stars. Still seen. Still worthy. This is not the end. This is the quiet beginning of your return.",
  "The Moon":
    "Two dogs — one white, one gray — gaze skyward in unison. They howl not at a full moon, but at a celestial being that is both sun and moon — a face divided, caught in profile. It radiates orange-gold rays, yet something about it feels uncanny. This duality is key: you are seeing light through layers of mist. \n\n The sky is not black but pale blue, like a twilight dreamscape. Golden leaves — or are they flames? — fall from the heavens, swirling between what is natural and what is imagined. They confuse the senses. Are they signs? Are they tricks? \n\n On the ground, green grass rolls gently, deceptively calm. But the presence of the two dogs — symbols of tamed and wild instincts — suggests an internal tension. You may be torn between what you think you know and what your gut tells you. \n\n The Moon warns of misdirection. You may be walking a path shrouded in fog, uncertain of the motives of others — or your own. Your subconscious is speaking now: through dreams, fears, intuition, and synchronicities. Will you listen? \n\n You don’t need to “solve” The Moon. You need to feel through it. Let go of control. Accept that not all things will be clear right now — but the truth is emerging, slowly, like a shape in the mist. You must move forward anyway, guided by instinct.",
  "The Sun":
    "The central sun beams with a serene, knowing face — human in form, divine in essence. Its eyes are wide and blue, its cheeks adorned with light, its expression calm and joyful. There’s no more hiding. No more confusion. Everything is out in the open. \n\n Surrounding it are brilliant sunflowers, faces tilted upward in reverence. These flowers bloom only when the sun is present — they remind us that growth thrives in authenticity. Below them, green leaves burst with life. Above, the clouds have parted, framing a clear blue sky. This is not a metaphorical light — this is the real thing. Your power. Your purpose. \n\n The Sun speaks of renewal. Of childlike joy. Of returning to your core self without apology. If you’ve been carrying heavy emotional burdens or navigating uncertainty, this card says: \n\n “You made it through. The warmth you feel now is real — and it’s yours.” \n\n This is a time of success, recognition, vitality, and play. Things are aligning. Your path is illuminated. You can trust your clarity now. \n\n You are radiant. The world feels your warmth. Let yourself be seen. Let yourself celebrate — not just outcomes, but existence itself. You have come full circle from shadow to light. From illusion to truth.",
  Judgement:
    "And now, the call. Not a whisper, not a nudge — but a trumpet, golden and divine, erupting from the clouds. This is the moment before rebirth, the final breath before transformation. Judgement is the reckoning, the echo in your bones that says: it's time. \n\n A great horn, ancient and loud, blasts from the sky. Its mouth stretches from the clouds, held by unseen celestial hands. Behind it, the blazing sun crests the horizon — not as warmth, but as illumination. Red wings, wide and divine, arch outward like a resurrection in motion. This isn’t quiet redemption. This is the blast that wakes the sleeping soul. \n\n The clouds part. Stars shimmer in the turquoise sky like truths finally remembered. The horn is not for others — it’s meant for you. There is no audience. There is no hiding. \n\n You are being summoned — not by guilt, but by clarity. The past no longer has power unless you give it. This is the moment you decide: Do I carry the old stories, or do I rise into my next chapter? \n\n There is no punishment here. Only a stark invitation: forgive, release, renew. \n\n This is not about perfection. It's about accepting your full self, even the shadows, and choosing to emerge anyway. \n\n The trumpet has sounded. Your soul hears it, even if your mind resists. You are not being judged — you are being invited. Rise. Not because you are flawless, but because you are ready. The sky is open. The past is done. Let the awakening begin.",
  "The World":
    "Exhale. You’ve reached the summit, not by chance, but by evolution. The World is the final arc, the sacred wholeness that follows the spiral journey — the fool who has walked through all fire, all stars, all shadows, and now returns… not the same. \n\n A hand — golden, cosmic, ancient — rises at the center, etched with symbols of the divine: moons, suns, stars, sacred geometry. Upon the palm rests a powerful orb — part sun, part moon — suggesting total harmony between opposites. You are not split anymore. You are aligned. \n\n A lush green wreath encircles the hand, interwoven with a red ribbon — the infinity knot of time and spirit. Completion is not stasis, but movement made whole. At the top and bottom of the wreath, swallows soar in tandem, bearing the clouds themselves. They are the messengers of joy, reunion, and sacred return. \n\n The sky is bright, the stars fixed and soft. Two golden pentacles anchor the corners — symbols of grounded success, of what has been made real in the material world. \n\n You are not standing still — you are standing centered. This card celebrates not just achievement, but integration. The inner self, the outer self, the journey, the purpose — all now form a complete constellation. You are home in yourself. \n\n You have arrived — but only because you dared to leave. Now the circle closes, and the spiral opens. What you sought is within. What you lost has been returned — transformed. The World invites you to dance, to rest, to acknowledge the sacredness of your becoming.",
  "Ace of Wands":
    "You are being handed fire. Not the destructive kind — the sacred kind. This is ignition. The Ace of Wands is the pulse of inspiration, the rush of energy that says: “Begin. Now.” \n\n A firm hand emerges from a parted cloud, clutching a slender wooden wand. From the wand, fresh green shoots sprout — life born from will, ideas blooming from action. The wand is simple, but powerful. It doesn’t speak. It calls. \n\n This isn’t a card of certainty — it’s a card of potential. The gray background is neutral, undefined. It hasn’t become anything yet. Because you haven’t chosen what to make of it — yet. But the clouds have cleared just enough to offer the gift. \n\n The Ace is a seed. It contains every possibility of the suit — creativity, adventure, desire, momentum. But it must be planted. It must be claimed. The hand is not holding it forever. \n\n This is divine timing. The wand is being offered to you now — not randomly, but because you’re ready. You might not feel ready. But the spark has already lit. The only question is whether you’ll act. \n\n Say yes. Take the wand. Trust the impulse. You don’t need a map — you need a spark. Creation begins with a flicker, not a blueprint. Let passion lead. Let life begin again. The fire is in your hands now.",
  "Two of Wands":
    "The fire has been lit — and now you must decide where it leads. The Two of Wands is a moment of pause, not from doubt, but from possibility. You stand between two paths, not lost, but poised. \n\n Two hands hold two wands, emerging from soft clouds. They mirror each other, steady and symmetrical, and between them dangles a golden crescent — the moon suspended like a pendulum. It is not waning or waxing, only waiting. This is a still point before movement. \n\n Each wand sprouts green life — potential born from boldness. You’ve already claimed the flame, and now your inner world is expanding outward. The sky is neutral gray, the backdrop of decision, of dreaming. You are neither at the start nor at the finish — you are at the threshold. \n\n This card speaks to vision: where do you want to go? What world do you wish to hold in your hands? The duality isn’t conflict — it’s clarity. The clouds are not stormy, but receptive. The moon, symbolic of intuition and the unconscious, hangs like a secret you already know but must choose to trust. \n\n Dare to envision boldly. The world you want is waiting to be chosen, not discovered. You already hold the power in both hands — now it’s about direction. Make your plans. Map the unknown. Set your sights far — and trust that your roots can reach that far too.",
  "Three of Wands":
    "This is the card of anticipation, foresight, and intentional movement. You’ve chosen your path — now the road opens. The Three of Wands speaks of momentum, of the first signs that your efforts are beginning to ripple outward. \n\n Three wands rise tall through gentle clouds against a soft night sky. Each is alive — leaves sprout, reaching toward the stars like ideas ready to manifest. They are evenly spaced, balanced — a trinity of action, vision, and readiness. The clouds part above and below, revealing space — possibility. \n\n You are not waiting for something to come to you. You are standing in your yes, watching the world respond. This is the energy of strategic expansion — shipping your creation, launching your vision, stepping into the unknown with trust that the work has already begun to shape the future. \n\n Stars dot the sky — blessings, guides, reminders that your path is lit. The card holds a still confidence — not static, but steady. You’ve sent out the signal. Now you watch to see what answers. \n\n You've cast your intentions out to sea. Trust the winds you summoned. Something is en route — perhaps not yet visible, but already in motion. Now is not the time to retreat. Hold your ground, scan the distance, and prepare — your future is arriving, one wave at a time.",
  "Four of Wands":
    "This card radiates joy, harmony, and communal delight. Where the Three looked outward, the Four comes home. It’s the hearthfire moment — a pause in the journey, not to stop, but to honor how far you’ve come and what now holds you. \n\n Four strong wands form an arch — a gateway, a structure, a frame of celebration. Fresh green leaves sprout from each, symbolizing life, growth, and support. The symmetry is sacred — this isn’t chaos, it’s creation made visible. Clouds float above like blessings descending, while broad green leaves below root the image in earthly grounding. \n\n This card is often a signal of a rite of passage — a wedding, a homecoming, a reunion, or even a breakthrough in the inner world. It’s joy not in isolation, but shared. You’re not just safe — you’re seen. And that kind of visibility brings healing. \n\n There’s an unspoken invitation in this card: come together, mark this moment. Something deserves to be honored. \n\n It’s time to celebrate — not just the finish line, but the fact that you’re still walking the path. Open your door. Light the candles. Let others witness your growth. Harmony isn’t something you chase — it’s something you build. And right now, you’re laying a foundation that will last.",
  "Five of Wands":
    "Here, energy splinters. Fire meets fire. Voices rise, wands clash, and the field fills with friction. But this isn’t destruction — it’s initiation. The Five of Wands is conflict, yes, but it is creative conflict, full of growth and grit. Iron sharpens iron. \n\n Five branches span the card, seemingly chaotic, yet held in a frame. Green leaves still sprout — despite the tension, life continues. The vibrant yellow background pulses with possibility, but also with restlessness. The clouds, once soft and idle, now look pushed aside — as if this space has become too tight to hold so many wills at once. \n\n This isn’t war. It’s competition. Training. A necessary clash of ideas, perspectives, or passions. Everyone wants the same thing — but the methods? The timing? The roles? That’s where the sparks fly. \n\n You may feel scattered, at odds with others or even yourself. But underneath the noise is a vital truth: growth requires friction. Don’t run from it. Engage it. Let the heat refine your vision. \n\n Not all struggle is bad. Not all tension is a threat. This is a forge — a proving ground. Let challenge strengthen your stance. Collaborate through the chaos. What looks like conflict now may be the exact crucible you need to claim your voice. Don’t seek harmony by silencing the fire — learn to move with it.",
  "Six of Wands":
    "The Six of Wands is triumph in motion. It arrives not in silence, but with wings and wind, a celebration of endurance and spirit. This card declares: you made it. You are not alone in your victory — others see you, honor you, even follow you now. \n\n Six tall wands stand rooted, firm and green with life — their alignment speaks of order after chaos. The night sky behind them is rich, deep, and proud. Out of it, birds swoop, red-chested and full of vitality, cutting across the frame in fluid arcs. They don’t just fly — they glide with confidence, purpose, and freedom. These are not birds escaping danger — they are birds returning home. \n\n The clouds, once turbulent in previous cards, now part gently. There is space here. There is breath. The message is simple: your growth has been noticed. Something you’ve poured your fire into — a cause, a craft, a choice — is finally bearing fruit. \n\n Yet this is not the end. It is the moment of recognition in the middle of the journey. You are being called a leader — and with that comes the sacred task of continuing forward with grace, humility, and clarity. \n\n You’ve crossed a threshold. The applause is deserved — accept it. But remember: this isn’t just about you. Use your platform to elevate others. Let the wings of your success create wind for others to soar. Shine — not in ego, but in example.",
  "Seven of Wands":
    "This is the card of the defender. The Seven of Wands appears when your light has grown bright enough to cast shadows, and those shadows now stir. But make no mistake: this card is not about defeat — it's about resilience. About refusing to step down from your truth, even when the world pushes back. \n\n Seven verdant wands flare outward like a fan, each sprouting leaves — alive, vibrant, defiant. They shoot up from the earth as if summoned by your will alone. Behind them, a fierce red-orange sky burns with urgency. And around them: white-hot stars, blazing like sparks from a divine forge. This is sacred tension. \n\n There are no figures here. No crowd, no enemies in sight. But you feel them. The opposition is real, even if it’s not visible. This card knows what it’s like to be challenged not by obvious threats, but by subtle ones — doubt, jealousy, competition, internal fears. You’ve made progress. You’ve stepped into visibility. Now you must protect what you’ve built. \n\n This is a test of endurance. Not because you are wrong, but because you are right enough to be noticed. And that makes people uncomfortable. Stay firm. Stay grounded. \n\n Stand in your fire — not with anger, but with clarity. You don’t need to lash out, just hold fast. You were not placed here to shrink. You were placed here to rise. Let the stars remind you: your light is worth defending.",
  "Eight of Wands":
    "The Eight of Wands is a bolt of momentum. It's that sudden whoosh when everything clicks into motion, when delays dissolve and you're flung forward with purpose. No more waiting. No more stagnation. This is liftoff. \n\n Eight flourishing wands streak across the sky in perfect diagonal formation, as if launched from the clouds themselves. Each one brims with green shoots — not weapons, but growth in flight. Behind them, the soft blue sky buzzes with speed, and below, golden hills anchor the vision with a sense of destination. \n\n There’s no hesitation here. These wands aren't questioning where they’re going — they already know. This card tells you that energy is finally aligning. Movement is imminent. Perhaps the project that’s been dragging will suddenly surge ahead. Or a conversation that once felt stalled will flow with unexpected ease. It's not random — it's earned release. \n\n Momentum is a force — but it must be directed. If you’re clear on your goal, this energy will serve you like a tailwind. If you’re scattered, it might rush past without landing. Your task now isn’t to create motion, but to ride it. Trust the speed. You are not behind — you are arriving exactly when you’re meant to. \n\n Go with the gust. Don’t pause to question how it all came together so fast. This is divine acceleration. Say yes. Hit send. Book the ticket. Speak the truth. The wind is with you.",
  "Nine of Wands":
    "The Nine of Wands is a card of resilience, boundaries, and vigilance. It speaks to those who have fought long and hard, who bear the marks of struggle, yet still rise to meet what comes next. You are not naive anymore. You know what it costs. And still — you grip that final wand. \n\n A single hand reaches down from above, grasping the ninth wand — the final piece in a tangled, chaotic pile of eight. The wands below are crossed and jumbled, green leaves still sprouting as a testament to survival, but the scene feels strained. This isn't fresh growth — it’s what has endured. And that hand? It’s steady. Determined. There’s still one move left. \n\n This card honors your exhaustion and your effort. You may be close to giving up. You may wonder if you can take one more blow. But you can. You have every right to be cautious, but don’t let that turn into defeatism. Defend what matters. Stand by what you’ve built. \n\n Sometimes strength isn’t loud. It’s not about charging forward. It’s about continuing despite. It’s quiet resolve. It’s choosing not to collapse. It’s the wisdom of knowing when to act — and when to protect your energy. \n\n Your past battles prepared you for this moment. You don’t need to prove anything. You are the proof. Rest if needed — but don’t lay down your wand. This is the final push before the breakthrough. You’re almost there.",
  "Ten of Wands":
    "The Ten of Wands is a card of burden, responsibility, and finality. The journey of fire — of vision, of purpose — has led here: a towering lattice of wands stretching from flame to star, beautiful and overwhelming. You’ve made it to the end, but you carry everything you’ve picked up along the way. \n\n This card’s art is striking: ten crisscrossed wands form a towering structure — symmetrical, rigid, heavy. A small flame burns at the base, the origin of this entire journey, while a brilliant star crowns the top. The message is clear: the fire of ambition led to construction, and now, the result is immense — maybe too much. \n\n This card often shows up when you're overwhelmed by the very things you once wished for. Success, responsibility, expectation — it builds up, and suddenly you're bending under the weight of your own legacy. It's not that you're on the wrong path. It’s that you’re trying to carry it all alone. \n\n You may feel stretched thin, exhausted, isolated. The Ten of Wands reminds you that delegation is not weakness, and rest is not failure. Let go of the nonessentials. Realign. Lighten your load. \n\n Sometimes the fire becomes too controlled. What started as inspiration can turn into obligation. Don’t let the structure you've built smother the flame within. \n\n You’ve reached the summit — now choose what you truly want to carry forward. You don’t have to bear the whole tower to honor the journey. Let some of it burn, if it frees your spirit. You’ve earned that release.",
  "Page of Wands":
    "The Page of Wands is the spark of creative potential, the youthful flame of curiosity, and the invitation to step onto a new stage. In this card’s imagery, a wand rests delicately on a red cushion, carried aloft by a cloud and framed by parted curtains — as if the universe is unveiling a gift or a performance about to begin. \n\n This card is the embodiment of new beginnings with fire. Unlike the burdened Ten of Wands, the Page is light, free, and untethered. You are being offered something — an idea, a passion, a calling — and it hovers before you with theatrical flair. The red curtains suggest drama and presence; this isn’t just a quiet nudge. It’s a spotlight moment. \n\n This Page invites you to explore with wonder. It doesn't promise a completed path or clear outcomes. It says: What if? What if you said yes to that impulse? What if you took the stage and played the role that’s been whispering in your soul? \n\n You may feel young, untested, or unsure — but that’s exactly where magic lives. Embrace the “beginner” within you. The Page doesn’t need mastery — it needs movement, curiosity, and fire. \n\n The cloud elevates the cushion, reminding you that inspiration is divine and fleeting — don’t let the chance pass you by. Take the wand. Step forward. \n\n There’s a story waiting to be written — and you're holding the pen. Don't worry about how it ends. Just begin. Say yes to your spark. The curtain has already risen.",
  "Knight of Wands":
    "The Knight of Wands is a card of bold action, fiery ambition, and confident charge. It represents the warrior spirit of the Wands suit: restless, determined, and unwilling to stay still. In the card’s imagery, a vibrant sun and three lunar phases sit behind a shield, cleaved by a flowering wand — the emblem of a champion driven by purpose and vision. \n\n This card bursts with energy. The Knight charges forward, undeterred by hesitation. The sun and moon symbols reflect a harmony between clarity and instinct — action backed by both illumination and intuition. The wand, alive with new growth, shows that this is no empty charge: it’s inspired, passionate, and filled with potential. \n\n When this card appears, it urges you to move. This is the moment to pursue your goals with courage. The Knight of Wands doesn’t wait for perfect conditions — they create them by acting. You may feel an impulse rising, a drive to leap into a new project, relationship, or journey. This card is a green light — with a warning. \n\n Because here’s the shadow: the Knight can be reckless. A fire without direction burns fast and out. Enthusiasm is powerful, but if untethered, it leads to burnout, scattered efforts, or forgotten responsibilities. The shield reminds you that true strength is not just speed — it's aim. \n\n The growth on the wand tells you this mission has meaning. Trust your drive — but steer it. \n\n Your fire is rising. Let it carry you — but don’t forget the reins. Ride forward with purpose, not just passion. The battle isn’t to rush — it’s to burn long and bright.",
  "Queen of Wands":
    "The Queen of Wands is the fire of intuition fused with grace, confidence, and creative sovereignty. She is the witch-queen of the deck — radiant and magnetic, yet rooted and wise. In the artwork, a crown floats just beneath the clouds, adorned with stars. Below it, a wand sprouts with new leaves, and a crescent moon rests gently beneath — a symbol of inner light, mystery, and feminine power. \n\n This card glows with self-assurance. The Queen of Wands doesn’t shout to be seen — she radiates. Her power isn’t born from domination, but from an unshakable sense of self. The star-crowned crown suggests leadership not through fear, but inspiration. The surrounding swirls and moons hint at a deep spiritual connection — a wisdom that flows with emotion, magic, and clarity. \n\n If this card has come to you, it's a call to embrace your inner sovereignty. You are being asked to step fully into your light — not by demanding space, but by becoming the space. Your passions are aligned, and your presence has influence. Whether you know it or not, you are inspiring others just by being authentic. \n\n But the Queen also warns: don’t burn out by trying to please everyone. Maintain your boundaries. Protect your energy like the precious ember it is. Lead with heart, not ego. \n\n Creativity, sexuality, and independence bloom here. You don’t need permission to own your fire. \n\n You are the throne. You are the wand. You are the moon. Step into the fire-lit crown of who you are becoming. Be bold. Be tender. Be your own kind of magic — the world will follow.",
  "King of Wands":
    "The King of Wands is the embodiment of bold leadership, vision, and charismatic mastery. He doesn’t just act — he inspires action. In this card, a strong hand grips a flowering wand, lifting it upward toward a radiant crown suspended in space. Around him swirl celestial symbols: stars, moon, sun — a whole cosmos in orbit around his will. This is not coincidence — it's magnetism. \n\n The King of Wands isn’t a ruler by title — he leads because others believe in him. The crown represents earned authority, not inherited power. The red background burns with purpose and passion. His hand on the wand shows ownership over the creative force — it’s not running wild; it’s being channeled. \n\n This card calls you to take the reins. Your ideas hold weight. Your energy has gravitational pull. But leadership demands courage and clarity. You may be at the threshold of a major role — whether in your work, your community, or your personal transformation. The King says: step up, own your fire, and guide others with it. \n\n But there’s a shadow, too: don’t let pride flare into ego. True leadership listens. True fire warms; it doesn’t scorch. \n\n This is your sign to act boldly — but with purpose. Stand tall in what you believe, and others will gather. \n\n The wand is in your hand. The crown is in reach. Trust your vision — not because it’s perfect, but because it’s yours. Let your leadership blaze not with control, but with conviction. The world needs your fire, lit with wisdom.",
  "Ace of Cups":
    "The Ace of Cups marks the beginning of emotional abundance, intuitive awakening, and love in its purest form. A hand emerges from a cloud, offering a golden chalice, glowing with potential. It’s a gift — but only if you’re open to it. \n\n This card is a holy invitation: to feel, to trust, to soften. The cup hovers weightlessly in a hand, as if even gravity respects the emotional energy it contains. The surrounding clouds part, as if this moment is sacred — because it is. \n\n The Ace of Cups shows up when something is ready to be born from the heart. It may be a new relationship, a creative passion, or a spiritual path opening up. It signals a surge of emotional clarity and purity — love not tainted by fear, expression not blocked by doubt. \n\n But receiving this energy means creating space for it. A closed heart cannot hold water. Are you willing to let your walls down? Are you ready to feel, fully? \n\n This card whispers: let it in. Let yourself be moved. Let the cup overflow. \n\n The divine is offering you connection — to others, to your purpose, to yourself. Open your hands. Open your heart. Something beautiful wants to pour through you.",
  "Two of Cups":
    "The Two of Cups speaks of sacred connection — love, partnership, and mutual recognition. It is the card of coming together in harmony. Whether in romance, friendship, or collaboration, this card says: something beautiful is forming, and it’s built on balance. \n\n In this image, two hands extend from the clouds, each holding a cup — one upright, one inverted — coming together to complete a whole. Between them: mirrored stars and radiant energy, emphasizing union and reciprocity. This isn’t just a meeting — it’s a mirroring of souls. \n\n This card often shows up when a meaningful bond is blooming. It could be romantic, yes, but it just as easily represents deep emotional healing, reconciliation, or the birth of a profound partnership. There’s magic here — but only when both parties offer equally. \n\n The Two of Cups reminds you: love is not about possession or sacrifice. It’s about reflection, giving, and being seen. The connection must flow both ways. \n\n A union is forming — one that could transform you. Enter with openness, honor the balance, and be willing to give as much as you receive. In shared vulnerability, true power is born.",
  "Three of Cups":
    "The Three of Cups radiates joy, connection, and communal abundance. It’s the card of celebration, friendship, and emotional kinship. When it appears, it signals that you're not meant to walk this path in solitude — others are here to lift you, dance with you, toast to your becoming. \n\n The image shows three golden cups, each held delicately by a hand, stacked in perfect balance. This arrangement suggests a harmony of equals — a shared emotional flow, not one pouring into another, but all uplifted together. The background sparkles, as if joy itself is crackling in the air. \n\n This card often arises around milestones — birthdays, weddings, creative breakthroughs, reunions — or simply times when connection heals. It's a reminder that nourishment isn't only food and water. It's laughter, shared experience, a touch on the shoulder when words fail. \n\n The Three of Cups tells you: make space for celebration. Say yes to connection. Even if life is heavy, there is magic in coming together — however briefly — to toast the now. \n\n Your joy is real — and it wants to be witnessed. Let others celebrate you. Seek out the ones who see your light and reflect it back. In shared joy, you’ll find renewal. In community, you’ll remember your wholeness.",
  "Four of Cups":
    "The Four of Cups is the card of emotional pause, inner stagnation, and contemplative discontent. It appears when you are surrounded by plenty — and yet feel unmoved, untouched. What was once fulfilling has grown dull. Something deeper stirs, waiting to be named. \n\n In this card’s artwork, two cups sit clearly on a table, but their reflection in the mirror shows four — a doubling that feels both magical and eerie. The mirror evokes self-reflection, memory, and the distortion of perception. Are you seeing what's really there? Or just what you expect? \n\n The Four of Cups surfaces when you’re emotionally checked out — bored, unmotivated, or trapped in a loop of dissatisfaction. It’s not that life has failed you; it’s that you’ve withdrawn from life. There’s a subtle call here: to wake up. To engage again. To stop scanning the past or fantasizing about 'what’s missing' — and see what’s being offered. \n\n This is a still moment, not a dead end. Boredom can be a sacred teacher. When you stop reaching outward, you start hearing the inner truth whispering underneath. \n\n Pause. Breathe. Feel. The answers won’t come from the mirror, but from your heart. Something is being offered — but you must be present to receive it. Shift your gaze. A new cup waits, just outside your frame of view.",
  "Five of Cups":
    "The Five of Cups is a card of grief, disappointment, and emotional reckoning. It surfaces when we are fixated on what has gone wrong or what we’ve lost, sometimes at the cost of noticing what remains. Pain is real, but so is what still stands. \n\n In the image, five cups form a precarious tower, each balanced delicately on cloudlike hands. The mood is tense — as if one wrong move could topple the whole thing. But if you look closely, nothing has fallen yet. The cups shimmer with light, untouched for now. The fear of collapse is just as vivid as the fall itself. \n\n This card asks: what are you focusing on — what’s missing, or what’s still here? Grief has a gravity, pulling our gaze to the broken pieces. But healing begins when we widen our vision. \n\n You might be carrying regret, sadness, or guilt. That’s okay. But you’re not empty. You’re not broken. Let yourself feel the loss — but don’t mistake it for the whole story. \n\n The clouds that hold the cups remind us: you’re supported, even now. Not everything is in your control, but not everything has slipped away either. \n\n Honor the hurt, but don’t live in the ruins. Some cups still stand — full, waiting. When you’re ready, turn toward them. A future is still possible, even if it looks different from the one you imagined.",
  "Six of Cups":
    "The Six of Cups evokes nostalgia, warmth, and the simple sweetness of the past. It is the card of memory, childhood, innocence — but also of emotional grounding and healing through connection. The past isn’t a place to live, but it can be a wellspring to draw from. \n\n The card shows six cups forming a blooming, loose spiral, cradled by a hand from below. A golden star glows at the center, like a forgotten treasure rediscovered. The background is night-black — the past is gone, but not erased. These cups don’t mourn; they dance, as if memories were being released back into motion. \n\n This card often appears when you’re revisiting something emotionally significant — an old relationship, a childhood dream, or a part of yourself you thought you outgrew. You might feel sentimental or drawn to reconnect with simpler times. \n\n The Six of Cups doesn’t urge you to retreat. Instead, it invites you to honor where you’ve come from. There is healing in remembering — and in reclaiming parts of yourself that you once cast aside. \n\n Let memory nourish you, not imprison you. The hand beneath the cups says: you’re safe to remember. You can carry the best of the past without being trapped by it. \n\n Reach into your roots — not to regress, but to rebuild with clarity. The joy, softness, or truth you once had isn’t lost. It’s waiting, like a star in your hand, to guide the next chapter.",
  "Seven of Cups":
    "The Seven of Cups is the card of illusion, fantasy, and choice. Here, each golden cup has wings — but we don’t know where they’re flying or if they’ll hold. The red background hums with seductive energy, but also with chaos. You are in a space filled with dazzling options — and hidden consequences. \n\n This card warns of wishful thinking and being overwhelmed by possibilities. Whether it's romantic, creative, or professional, something in your life is offering too many choices or painting an unrealistic picture. Are you chasing a dream that may not hold up under closer inspection? \n\n The winged cups suggest tempting opportunities — each one potentially lifting you to greater heights… or sending you falling. Are you choosing with intention or reacting to desire? The swirling red sky speaks to distraction, passion, and confusion. \n\n This card doesn't say “don’t choose” — it says “choose wisely.” Ground yourself. Ask: what is real, what is illusion, and what serves your highest good? \n\n Fantasy can be fuel — or a trap. You can only fly when you know what you’re flying toward. Let discernment be your wings.",
  "Eight of Cups":
    "In the Eight of Cups, we see seven cups left behind in shadow — some toppled, some still upright — and one solitary cup placed carefully above the arch, separated from the rest. The archway represents a threshold, a passage, a decision. The blue background offers a sense of quietude, but not comfort. This is not a card of endings, but of voluntary departure. \n\n This card speaks to emotional disillusionment and the quiet ache of walking away. You may have poured your heart into something — a relationship, a dream, a role — but it no longer fulfills you. You’re not fleeing chaos; you're searching for something deeper, something true. \n\n The single cup placed at the top of the arch hints at hope. It says, “There’s more beyond this.” The tilted cups on the other side show what’s been outgrown, discarded, or lost. But it’s not failure — it’s release. \n\n You are called now to honor what no longer serves, and to have the courage to move toward what might. \n\n Sometimes, the greatest act of love is leaving.

    "The Nine of Cups shows nine golden chalices carefully arranged in a structured, balanced grid beneath draped garlands, all set against a soft, neutral backdrop. This is a scene of completion, of earned comfort — like a quiet banquet held in your honor. \n\n Often called 'the wish card', the Nine of Cups is a sign that your desires — whether material, emotional, or spiritual — are within reach or already manifesting.

After effort, healing, and introspection, you deserve this fullness. \n\n But — and this is important — the card also gently asks: Are you enjoying this moment fully, or are you waiting for the next thing to chase? \n\n You’ve poured into these cups — now sip from them.

  "Ten of Cups":
    "The Ten of Cups is the culmination of emotional harmony, joy, and unity.

This is the rainbow after the rain, the homecoming after the journey, the love that doesn’t just fill you but surrounds you. \n\n The card’s imagery shows ten cups encircling a bold red heart, suspended in a soft sea of clouds. These clouds suggest ease, gentleness, and emotional elevation — as if this love, this happiness, is both grounded and divine. The heart at the center isn’t just a romantic symbol; it’s the axis of everything — the beating truth around which all joy gathers. \n\n This card often appears when emotional fulfillment is either within reach or already in your grasp.

Love that radiates out, not just within. \n\n At its highest expression, this card tells you: you’re safe to receive joy. Safe to dream of lasting peace. Safe to believe in a version of happiness that doesn’t ask you to shrink.

Sometimes, it’s about learning to recognize joy when it finally knocks — not as a trick, but as the truth. \n\n Let your heart be the hearth. Let the love around you reflect the love within. This is not a fleeting high — it’s a circle of cups, a constellation of care. You are home. You are whole. You are loved.",
  "Page of Cups":
    "The Page of Cups is a messenger of emotional openness, creative awakening, and surprising sincerity. It’s the first whisper of love, the gentle tug of intuition, the dream that dares to speak its name. When this card appears, expect the unexpected — in the most tender way. \n\n Here, a golden cup rests delicately atop a plush red pillow, floating on a soft cloud. Curtains part as though a stage is being revealed, and beneath it all, vivid red tulips bloom. This is a scene of invitation — something heartfelt is being offered.

You may find yourself feeling more tender than usual, more inspired, or more drawn to express love in unusual ways. Trust that. \n\n Innocence doesn’t mean naivety — it can be a strength, a way of staying open in a world that teaches us to close off. This Page brings healing not through control, but through curiosity. \n\n Say yes to the spark. Follow the whisper. Even if it seems small or silly, even if your mind resists, your heart knows. There’s a gift behind the curtain — let yourself receive it.",
  "Knight of Cups":
    "The Knight of Cups rides forth not to conquer, but to connect. This is the romantic, the dreamer, the messenger of love and emotion. Where other knights chase victory or order, this one follows the subtle pull of the heart — wherever it dares to lead. \n\n This card features a solitary cup resting before a grand shield. The shield bears a blazing sun, a crescent moon, and mirrored orbs — symbols of emotional duality, vision, and harmony.

You don’t have to detach to protect yourself. You are allowed to care — and still carry power. \n\n Your empathy is a gift, not a weakness. Trust what you feel, and don’t be afraid to set your crown on the truth that arises from your intuition. Lead your life with grace — not because the world deserves it, but because you do.",

    "The King of Cups is the serene anchor in turbulent seas — a sovereign of emotional wisdom, calm resolve, and quiet strength. He does not suppress his feelings, but channels them with intention.

Can you feel without losing yourself? \n\n This card is an invitation to hold space — for yourself, for others — without judgment or overwhelm. You are more grounded than you think, and the crown is within reach when you choose steadiness over reactivity. \n\n You are being called to be both the healer and the held — to carry calm in your palm and wisdom in your cup.

  "Ace of Swords":
    "The Ace of Swords is the first breath of truth, the flash of insight that cuts through fog. It is the birth of thought, discernment, and unflinching clarity. Where confusion once clouded the sky, this card arrives like a blade through silence, heralding new awareness and decisive power. \n\n In the image, a firm hand emerges from a cloud, gripping a shining sword. Light radiates from the blade, illuminating the muted, gray-brown background. There is no blood here, no aggression — just precision, resolve, and the calm after revelation. The clouds part for this moment of lucidity. The sword isn’t swung yet — it’s offered. \n\n This card appears when truth is ready to surface.

  "Two of Swords":
    "The Two of Swords speaks of inner tension, stalemate, and the quiet pause before a decision. It’s the moment of equilibrium before action — a delicate balance between opposing thoughts, feelings, or choices. This is not a card of clarity, but of stillness, asking you to look inward rather than outward. \n\n The image shows two hands gripping swords crossed in a mirrored stance, locked yet unmoving. Above them floats a blank ribbon — no message, no decision — just the open potential of what could be. A crescent moon hovers above, shrouded in partial shadow, and below, a radiant white star offers hope or disruption, depending on what path is taken. \n\n The symmetry in the card suggests duality — not just a choice, but the weight of choosing. Logic may pull one way while emotion tugs another. There may be pressure to decide, yet your heart stalls. The lack of background imagery mirrors the inner void — the hush before truth reveals itself. \n\n This card invites you not to rush. Sometimes, choosing too soon leads to regret. Sometimes, silence is needed to uncover the real answer beneath surface noise. \n\n The Two of Swords urges reflection. Not everything can be solved with action. Sit with discomfort. Listen to your own stillness. What you resist looking at may hold the key to your peace. \n\n Drop the need to win the mental battle. This isn’t about sides — it’s about truth. Remove the blindfold not from your eyes, but from your heart. The answer lives where silence meets honesty.",
  "Three of Swords":
    "The Three of Swords is one of the most piercing cards in the tarot deck, symbolizing heartbreak, betrayal, grief, or painful truth. This is not a subtle wound — it is the kind that splits the heart open and demands you feel it. But in this rawness, there is also clarity. The illusion has been pierced. What remains is real. \n\n The image is striking: a bold red heart impaled by three silver swords, each piercing from a different angle. The clouds behind are heavy and curling, framing the heart like a stage curtain around a tragedy. These are not accidental cuts. Each sword has a purpose — mental clarity, truth, confrontation. \n\n This card rarely arrives quietly. It surfaces when an emotional rupture is happening or imminent — a breakup, a loss, a hard truth coming to light. But the swords here are of the mind, not the body. This isn’t chaos — it’s confrontation with something that was already hurting, now made impossible to ignore. \n\n The pain it brings is not punishment — it is release. Sometimes, it takes heartbreak to wake us from denial. Sometimes, grief is the doorway to truth. The Three of Swords demands we look — without flinching — at what hurts, and ask why. \n\n Healing begins not with mending the heart, but understanding the wound. Let the tears fall. Let the sky weep with you. You’re not breaking — you’re becoming aware. \n\n What hurts now is showing you what mattered. Don't rush to patch the break. There is medicine in the sorrow — a truth sharp enough to cut, and clean enough to heal.",
  "Four of Swords":
    "The Four of Swords is a card of pause, peace, and necessary stillness. It appears like a breath between battles — not the end of struggle, but the sacred quiet between chapters. This is your sign to lay down your arms, even if just for now. \n\n Four upright swords stand in perfect alignment, like silent sentinels guarding a moment of peace. The background is a serene sky-blue, dotted with quiet sparkles — a visual hush. Red tulips bloom at the base, vibrant yet soft, growing not in chaos but in stillness. Above, a gentle drape mimics the covering of a bed or a sanctuary, suggesting retreat and repose. \n\n This card arrives when your mind has been overworked, your heart overburdened, or your spirit stretched thin. It urges a deliberate step back. Not in defeat — but in preservation. You are being invited into recovery, to retreat not out of fear, but wisdom. \n\n The swords here aren’t clashing. They’re suspended, held in peace. You are being asked to withdraw — from conflict, from noise, from urgency — and trust that restoration is not laziness, but strategy. \n\n Your inner garden needs time to regrow. Let your mind quiet. Let your dreams rise to the surface, uninterrupted. \n\n Honor the pause. In the silence between thoughts, in the stillness between actions, you’ll rediscover your center. Clarity doesn’t come when you fight for it — it blooms when you rest.",
  "Five of Swords":
    "The Five of Swords is a card of conflict, but not always of triumph. Here, the battle may be won — but the silence afterward speaks of something unsettled. Swords, though perfectly aligned, pierce through a tree's silhouette — suggesting not harmony, but damage done in order to maintain order. \n\n The swords float horizontally across a stark golden-yellow backdrop, each embedded into the silhouette of a leafless, jagged tree. Though the scene appears organized at first glance, it quickly reveals an unsettling tension. The blades are pristine — but the tree is lifeless. The cost of control, it suggests, may be something organic, something irreplaceable. \n\n This card often surfaces when you're entangled in a situation where pride, ego, or need for control has overridden compassion or understanding. Perhaps you’ve gotten the last word, but it left more distance than resolution. Or perhaps you're feeling like someone else’s victory came at your expense. \n\n It asks: is the position you’ve defended worth the isolation it might bring? The swords are trophies now, but what have they severed? \n\n Whether you are the victor or the wounded, the message is the same: reflect before engaging again. Is there another way? A wiser battle? Or is this the time to lay your weapon down and seek reconciliation? \n\n True strength lies not in domination, but in discernment. Beware the thrill of hollow victories. Choose healing over winning, and peace over pride.",
  "Six of Swords":
    "The Six of Swords represents a quiet transition, a necessary journey from turbulence toward something steadier. It doesn’t promise instant peace, but it assures you that the worst has passed, and healing is already underway — even if you don’t yet feel it. \n\n Six swords cross at the center, forming a tightly-woven lattice held by six hands. Each blade seems to push against the others, yet together they form structure — not conflict. A bold orange star bursts overhead, like a distant destination or guiding light. Below, a crescent moon cradles the base of the formation, echoing emotional release and intuition. The background is pitch black, dotted with tiny crescent moons — night is here, but stars are rising. \n\n This card appears when you're in motion — not always physically, but emotionally or mentally. You're leaving behind something that no longer serves you: an argument, a draining environment, a state of mind that held you in place. It may feel like loss, but it is in fact liberation. Even the sorrow you're carrying is lighter than what you’ve already left behind. \n\n The darkness around you isn’t danger — it’s the unknown. And it’s okay to not yet know what’s next. The movement is what matters. The star above says: trust the pull forward. \n\n Healing begins in the leaving. In the choosing. Even if your hands shake, you’re holding your course. \n\n You are mid-crossing. Let go of what you can’t carry. Trust the hands around you — seen or unseen — and move forward. You are not lost. You are in passage.",
  "Seven of Swords":
    "The Seven of Swords is a card of cunning, strategy, and the subtle art of maneuvering behind the scenes. It can speak of trickery — but also of outsmarting what would entrap you. This is the card of quiet moves, hidden motives, and clever survival. \n\n Seven swords cut diagonally across a vibrant coral-red background, each angled with uneasy precision. Intertwined between them bloom vivid red roses — soft, open, and exposed — in stark contrast to the steel blades that seem almost too neatly placed. The composition whispers tension. Beauty and danger coexisting. Vulnerability within a field of sharp awareness. \n\n This card arises when something is being done behind the curtain — whether by you, or to you. It asks: are you protecting yourself wisely, or hiding out of fear? Are you navigating a situation with integrity, or slipping into shadows that will cost you more in the long run? Sometimes survival demands quiet tactics. Other times, secrets rot the ground beneath our feet. \n\n The roses here remind us: even amid stealth, there must be honesty with the self. Let the beauty of your motives be clear to you — even if your actions are concealed from others. \n\n If you’re keeping something hidden, ask why. If you feel betrayed, examine the deeper story. The swords speak in silence, but the roses still bloom in truth. \n\n Tread carefully, but not dishonestly. Strategy is wise — deception is weighty. Let your heart be as sharp as your mind, and your steps will be both clever and clean.",
  "Eight of Swords":
    "The Eight of Swords speaks to entrapment — the kind woven not by circumstance, but by perception. It’s the card of mental binds, limiting beliefs, and invisible prisons. But also, crucially, the possibility of escape. \n\n Eight swords form a radiant cage around a central orange starburst. The sky behind them is a pale blue, dreamy and light — not a threatening storm, but a day veiled by fog. Billowing white clouds surround the blades, obscuring vision, creating a sense of entanglement in softness. There is no figure in sight, and yet — the trap is there. Not of steel, but of illusion. \n\n This card often shows up when you feel stuck, limited, or powerless — but the message is clear: the walls aren’t solid. The swords don’t touch. The clouds aren’t stone. The true cage is within. What you fear may be a mirage sustained by self-doubt, shame, or old narratives you’ve outgrown. \n\n It’s important to acknowledge the fear — but don’t give it total authority. The Eight of Swords calls for courage, not just action. It invites you to peel back the clouded stories you’ve been telling yourself and to see where you might be free already. \n\n The exit is there. It might require asking for help, changing your mindset, or letting go of control. But it begins by realizing: this cage has a door — and the key might be in your hand already. \n\n When you believe you're trapped, you stop looking for exits. But freedom begins with the courage to challenge your own thoughts. Gently, but boldly, loosen what binds you. The sky is clearer than you think.",
  "Nine of Swords":
    "The Nine of Swords is the card of anxiety, nightmares, and the burdens of the mind. It doesn’t foretell disaster — it reflects the weight of fear, shame, or regret that has been allowed to fester in silence. It’s the echo chamber of the psyche, and its message is urgent: bring the shadows to light. \n\n Nine swords appear bundled tightly, bound at their hilts by a delicate black thread. They stand upright, pressed together like thoughts too long held in. Behind them, a brownish-gray void radiates faint white lines — like panic spiraling outward. There's no chaos here, only pressure. Order without peace. \n\n This card suggests you've been carrying a mental or emotional load alone. Sleeplessness, overthinking, guilt, grief — these are the silent companions of the Nine of Swords. The card doesn’t mock you for your struggle. It validates the weight. But it also urges a reckoning. \n\n The string binding the swords is thin. It wouldn’t take much to loosen. These fears may feel permanent, but they are not. The Nine reminds us: you cannot heal what you hide from. It’s time to speak, to cry, to confess — or simply to let yourself feel, fully and honestly. \n\n The darkness is not your enemy — avoidance is. If you can look directly at what pains you, it begins to lose its power. \n\n  The mind creates its own prison — but also its own door. What you fear may be real, but it is survivable. Let your pain breathe. Share the weight. Dawn follows even the longest night.",
  "Ten of Swords":
    "The Ten of Swords is a card of painful finality, collapse, and often betrayal. But despite its grim reputation, this card is not a death sentence — it’s a turning point. It represents the moment when things fall apart so completely that there is no illusion left to cling to… and with that, a strange kind of freedom. \n\n A single hand reaches from a cloud above, lowering the final sword. Below, nine others lie scattered on the ground — tangled, abandoned, spent. A once-coiled storm has passed, replaced by a soft peach sky. Vines with orange flowers hang down gently from above, hinting at life after devastation. The colors are tender, almost forgiving — an emotional contradiction to the harshness of the imagery. \n\n This card may appear when you've hit emotional, mental, or spiritual rock bottom. Something you hoped would last has ended — a relationship, an illusion, a belief. The pain is real. But the Ten of Swords offers this: it’s over now. The worst is named. There’s nothing more to fear. From this stillness, something new can grow. \n\n The final sword is not striking with cruelty. It’s completing the cycle. A full release. This is surrender not as defeat, but as sacred conclusion. The pain has already happened — now comes the part where you begin again. \n\n The earth is fertile after collapse. The vines above suggest rebirth, the light returning. You may feel broken, but the truth is: the lie is what broke. You remain. \n\n It ends here — but not you. Let what’s done fall away. Let the final sword descend. You’ll rise lighter, clearer, unburdened. From this ground, the truest growth begins.",

This is the card of the thinker, the observer, the one who watches the horizon with wide eyes and a ready spirit. \n\n A single sword floats serenely atop a plush red cushion, cradled by a small cloud — a gift of thought emerging from the ether. On either side, deep blue curtains part like a stage, drawing you into a world of fresh ideas and emerging truths. Young green plants sprout below, tender but reaching, their upward growth mirroring the Page’s thirst for discovery. \n\n This card appears when you're entering a phase of learning or revelation. The energy is sharp and electric — thoughts racing, questions rising. Like a student enchanted by their first real mystery, you are invited to pursue answers.

Your thoughts, your voice, your insights have power. Now is the time to sharpen them with integrity. \n\n Let your mind be open, but not chaotic. Let your questions be pointed, but not cutting. You are at the threshold of something important — and your intellect is the key. \n\n The sword of clarity hovers before you. Take it with grace. Ask the bold questions.

    "The Knight of Swords arrives with velocity — a force of intellect, conviction, and determination. He does not wait for the world to decide; he cuts through doubt with reason and willpower. But as swift as he rides, he must be sure his direction is just. \n\n A gleaming sword pierces through a red and white shield, emblazoned with the dual forces of sun and moon — action and intuition, reason and instinct. Behind it, rust-colored mountains speak to challenges already faced or still rising. Above, vibrant garlands and blossoms hang down, reminders that clarity and aggression must be tempered with care. \n\n This is a card of bold momentum. You may feel the urge to act, to speak your truth, to pursue a vision with sharp clarity. And that urge is not wrong — but it must be guided by both strategy and empathy. \n\n The imagery of balance — day and night — reminds us that not all battles are external. Some are of the mind, of ethics, of restraint. The Knight can be a hero or a zealot depending on his compass. What matters now is not just that you move, but why and how you do so. \n\n Let your intellect be your blade, but let your values be the hand that wields it. \n\n Do not fear the charge — but question its destination.

Below it, a silver sword hovers over a radiant sun, glowing like an unwavering truth. The backdrop is vivid yellow, the color of clarity and consciousness. Every element on this card beams with lucidity. \n\n The Queen of Swords invites you to adopt her mindset: clear, fair, and direct. This card often appears when you must make decisions unclouded by sentimentality — when boundaries must be drawn, truths spoken, and emotional fog lifted. \n\n She is perceptive but not cold.

The clouds suggest your thoughts may be stirred, but the crown assures you that sovereignty is found through reason. \n\n Let your inner queen rise — the one who speaks with candor, sees through masks, and leads with unwavering clarity. \n\n Your mind is your crown. Wield your truth with grace, and don’t fear being seen as “too sharp.” Sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is speak plainly, act wisely, and know your worth.",

This is potential in its rawest form: untouched, unspent, full of promise. You’ve been handed a key — now you must find the door. \n\n A single, radiant hand emerges from the clouds, cradling a golden coin etched with a pentacle. The background is a muted, earthen brown — steady, grounded, unshakable. Light rays shimmer outward from the coin, suggesting divine intention. This isn’t random. This is a blessing, handed down. \n\n The symbolism is clear: you are being offered something real — a chance, a foundation, a seed. But it must be claimed. It must be cultivated.

  "Two of Pentacles":
    "The Two of Pentacles is the card of balance, adaptability, and managing life’s flux with grace. It acknowledges that life rarely moves in straight lines — it twists, doubles, and asks us to juggle. This card appears when you’re walking the tightrope between responsibilities, relationships, or priorities. \n\n Two hands reach from opposite directions, each holding a golden pentacle — mirroring one another in perfect symmetry. The background is a soft gray, a neutral field of possibilities and uncertainty, peppered with geometric constellations.

What is quietly starving? \n\n The Two of Pentacles invites you to reprioritize, re-center, and know that imbalance is not failure — it’s a signal to adjust. \n\n You don’t have to drop everything — but you do have to decide what matters most. Let your values, not your fears, guide your balance. \n\n You’re not meant to hold everything forever. Let rhythm replace rigidity. Trust the dance. Let go where needed. Hold tight where it counts.

Whether you're building something physical, emotional, or spiritual, you’re not meant to carry it alone. \n\n It may be time to ask: Who helps lift your vision? Who do you build with?

  "Four of Pentacles":
    "The Four of Pentacles arrives when there is something being clutched — a coin, a comfort, a fear of loss. It is the card of security, but also of stagnation. It whispers of protection, but warns of possessiveness. \n\n Four golden pentacles descend in a perfect vertical stack from cloud to fingertip — a divine offering suspended in balance. A single hand, poised and firm, supports the lowest coin with precision. Around it, radiant sunflowers bloom — vibrant, but still. The sky is soft and clear, like a held breath. \n\n This card speaks of your relationship to material stability, control, or boundaries. It may be money, status, routines — anything that feels safe. And yet, the message is clear: safety should not become a cage. What you grip too hard can become brittle. \n\n The coins here aren’t falling — but they’re not rising either. This balance, though graceful, is delicate. If fear of loss keeps you from growth, or if you measure worth only by what you can hold, you may miss the abundance blossoming all around you. \n\n Look around. What are you protecting? What are you afraid to lose? And is the act of holding it so tightly costing you more than it's giving? \n\n Wealth is not just what you keep — it’s what you allow to flow. True security comes not from locking everything down, but from trusting yourself enough to open your hands. Let the sunflowers remind you: even beauty needs space to bloom.",
  "Five of Pentacles":
    "The Five of Pentacles is a card of hardship, but also of resilience. It appears when you’re navigating loss, scarcity, or a feeling of being left out in the cold — physically, emotionally, or spiritually. Yet within this card is also the quiet promise of hope, support, and survival. \n\n Five golden pentacles tumble from gray-draped clouds above, cascading like coins through an amber sky. Rain streaks faintly across the scene — a quiet drizzle rather than a storm. At the bottom of the image, a restless sea awaits, where one pentacle lands with a gentle ripple. Though the sky is heavy and the water uncertain, the light still glows. \n\n This card often shows up during times of financial stress, isolation, or emotional depletion. It reflects the feeling of being cast out, unseen, or unsupported. But it also reminds us that these feelings, though real, are not permanent — and not always reflective of the truth. \n\n The pentacles continue to fall. Help may be closer than you think — but you must lift your gaze to see it. Sometimes, pride or fear keeps us from reaching out. The Five of Pentacles urges compassion — especially toward yourself. \n\n This is a card that asks: Where do you feel abandoned? And where might you be abandoning yourself? \n\n Pain isolates — but it also invites connection. Don’t suffer in silence. Whether it’s a warm room, a helping hand, or a belief in better days, something is still shining for you. You are not forgotten. Reach for it.",
  "Six of Pentacles":
    "The Six of Pentacles is the card of generosity, balance, and karmic exchange. It arrives when you're being asked to consider the flow of resources — be they material, emotional, or energetic. Giving and receiving are not opposites — they are partners in sacred rhythm. \n\n Six golden pentacles form a radiant flower around a central white star — the symbol of balance and brightness — suspended in a black sky. Beneath them, two dogs gaze upward, one light and one dark, symbolizing duality and interdependence. Constellations map out faint paths above them, suggesting unseen connections and cosmic fairness. One dog may be receiving, the other offering — and the roles are fluid. \n\n This card calls attention to how you interact with abundance. Are you offering help without condescension? Are you receiving without shame? The night sky here reminds us that all exchanges are cosmic — no gift is wasted, no need shameful. \n\n Whether you're the giver or the one in need, both roles hold power. This card asks you to examine your relationship to support — are you hoarding, overextending, undervaluing? \n\n Real generosity uplifts both parties. It’s a two-way current. Like breath — inhale and exhale. \n\n The hand that gives and the hand that receives are both held by the same universe. Give freely. Receive openly. The stars above you bless both acts equally.",
  "Seven of Pentacles":
    "The Seven of Pentacles is the card of cultivation and reflection. It appears when you’ve already sown effort and energy, and now — you’re being called not to act, but to assess. It’s a sacred moment of stillness in the midst of long-term growth. \n\n A white ram’s skull sits firmly at the base of the card — ancient, weathered, enduring. From its horns spring seven golden pentacles, arrayed like fruit from a hard-earned harvest. Red roses bloom below, lush and full of life, while red leaves tumble gently from above, suggesting the passage of time and cycles. \n\n This card speaks to patient diligence. You’ve planted something meaningful. Now, you must step back to ask: is it growing as it should? Are the returns worth the effort? Are you building something that nourishes your soul — or simply staying busy? \n\n The skull is a memento mori — a reminder that time is precious, and everything matures in its own way. Yet from this symbol of death springs richness and vitality. What you’ve worked for may take time, but it’s alive, becoming. \n\n This is a moment to evaluate, not abandon. Trust the roots you’ve tended — but don’t be afraid to prune what no longer serves. \n\n Pause and look at the garden you’ve made. Something real is growing. Tend to it with care — and dare to ask if it’s what you still want to harvest.",

    "The Eight of Pentacles is the card of diligent work, focus, and skill-building. It appears when you're in the midst of refinement — not yet finished, but wholly devoted to the craft. This is the sacred space where effort meets excellence. \n\n Eight golden pentacles are neatly arranged into an L-shape, grounded in vibrant green leaves and crowned by three radiant stars. The background is a pale blue sky, clean and open, suggesting clarity of purpose and a calm dedication. There’s no chaos here — only steady creation. \n\n This card signals a season of learning through doing. You may be honing a new craft, deepening a skill, or simply committing yourself more fully to something meaningful. The stars above suggest guidance — perhaps even destiny — but it is through repetition and labor that their light becomes yours. \n\n There’s beauty in the process, even when it’s tedious. Every stroke, every detail, every correction is a step toward mastery. This card honors the hands-on journey. It doesn’t promise overnight success — but it whispers of something earned, something lasting. \n\n Let yourself be devoted. Trust that the daily, deliberate work you do — even if it feels unseen — is part of something greater unfolding. \n\n Focus on the process, not just the prize. Each effort is a prayer, each repetition a spell. Keep working — you’re crafting something that will endure.",
  "Nine of Pentacles":
    "The Nine of Pentacles is a card of independence, refinement, and the rewards of personal effort. It appears like a soft bell ringing in a quiet garden — a sign that the fruits of your labor have begun to bloom in fullness. \n\n A lone black bird — regal, watchful — perches atop a pyramid of nine golden pentacles. The background is a soft, muted brown, framed by swirling floral patterns, tiny stars glimmering throughout. It evokes luxury not through excess, but through elegance and control. This is a card of self-made harmony. \n\n The bird is significant. It watches with intelligence, suggesting wisdom and discernment. You are being invited to acknowledge how far you’ve come — and to celebrate not just what you’ve gathered, but the discipline and grace it took to get here. \n\n This card is often linked to financial independence, self-sufficiency, and living on your own terms. But at its core, it’s about inner richness. You’ve cultivated a sanctuary — whether external or emotional — and now is the time to enjoy it. \n\n Let yourself feel the satisfaction. You don’t need to apologize for comfort or beauty. You earned this. Just don’t forget: the soul of this card is quiet joy — not flaunting, but resting in wholeness. \n\n Success is sweeter when it’s soul-aligned. Stand tall in what you’ve created. The abundance you enjoy now is not luck — it’s a mirror of your patience, care, and quiet power.",
  "Ten of Pentacles":
    "The Ten of Pentacles is the card of fulfillment, legacy, and long-term abundance. It speaks not just to success, but to sustained success — the kind that nurtures others, that roots itself in home, tradition, and contribution. \n\n A hand emerges from a tasseled canopy — soft, ceremonial, deliberate — placing a coin gently into a field where nine others are nestled among tall blades of grass. This isn't a wild harvest; it's a cultivated one. Every coin is surrounded by lush green growth, suggesting investments that are thriving — not just materially, but spiritually and emotionally. \n\n The scene feels both intimate and sacred, as if this act is part of a ritual. The hand is not hoarding, but offering. This card reminds us: wealth is most powerful when it circulates. When what you build is shared — with family, with future generations, or with the wider world — it becomes something eternal. \n\n It may reflect inheritance, property, or family traditions — but even more so, it encourages you to reflect on the kind of legacy you’re creating. What values are you embedding into what you’re building? \n\n What you give attention to now will shape your future — and possibly someone else’s. This is a moment to think in decades, not days. \n\n True wealth lies in what lasts. Give with care, build with intention, and remember: when roots run deep, the bloom is inevitable. You are laying down something that will stand the test of time.",
  "Page of Pentacles":
    "The Page of Pentacles is the student of the material world — diligent, grounded, and full of wide-eyed curiosity. It heralds the beginning of a tangible pursuit: a new job, a study path, a financial plan, or even the nurturing of a creative idea that could bear real-world fruit. \n\n At center stage, a single pentacle rests atop a red tasseled cushion, carried aloft by a soft, swirling cloud. Flanked by parted green curtains, the scene is set like a theater unveiling — the moment before the act begins. Below, golden sunflowers rise eagerly, basking in potential. The sky glows a gentle peach, suggesting optimism and warmth — a fertile time for new beginnings. \n\n This image is rich with symbolism: the coin elevated like a prize or a sacred relic; the cloud, light and mobile, promising inspiration and motion; the cushion, a symbol of honor and intention. Something precious is being offered to you — but it’s not yet fully formed. The Page invites you to learn, to plan, to dream with structure. \n\n It is a card of preparation. Of saying “yes” to the process, not just the result. \n\n You are being handed a gift — perhaps an idea, an opportunity, or the chance to start fresh. But to make it bloom, you'll need commitment, consistency, and patience. This is the energy of apprenticeships, blueprints, and seedlings in soil. \n\n The future is not found — it’s crafted.
